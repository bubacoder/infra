## Reinstall a Docker host

Note: This method is a bit unconventional but simplifies the deployment (and possible rollback) procedure a lot.
A new VM is used to deploy the OS, then the new system disk is attached to the old VM, which is already configured.

Hosts involved:
- `OLD`: perform on the old host
- `NEW`: perform on the new host
- `PVE`: perform on the Proxmox VE host

Steps:

- OLD: Install the new host using `proxmox/create-ubuntu-server-vm.sh`
- OLD: Apply ansible using `ansible/apply-homelab.sh`
- OLD: Transfer container images to save bandwidth (Optional, see: [Docker](docker))

Optional: copy **Server Host Key**, an RSA, ED25519, or ECDSA private key

- NEW: Create mount point: `mkdir -p /mnt/local/storage/`
- NEW: Add `/mnt/local/storage/` to `/etc/fstab`, e.g.: `/dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid-of-storage> /mnt/local/storage ext4 defaults 0 0`
- NEW: Shutdown the VM

- PVE-NEW: OS Disk -> Disk Action -> Reassign Owner -> select OLD
- PVE-OLD: Options -> Boot Order -> Set the NEW disk to 1st position

- OLD: Shutdown, then start the VM

- OLD: Create symlink to repos: `ln -s /mnt/local/storage/repos ~/repos`
- OLD: Start services using `task docker:apply`

- PVE: After verification, delete the temporary VM
