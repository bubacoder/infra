## Directory structure

- `ansible` -- Configuration of the host OS & required software
  - `ansible/roles` -- Roles for Debian-based Docker & admin hosts and a Mac-based DevOps/SRE toolset
  - `ansible/playbooks` -- Host-role assignments. The playbooks can be executed with the `apply-*.sh` scripts
  - `ansible/inventory` -- Host specific environment configuration

## Setup steps

1. Instal Ansible on the admin workstation with `bootstrap-ansible.sh`. (See: [Ansible control node](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html#control-node))
2. Configure variables in `inventory/group_vars/`
3. Add hosts to `inventory/inventory.yaml`
4. Assign roles to hosts in `playbooks/`
5. Run `apply-<playbook>.sh` to execute a playbook
   - If you use a non-root user and `sudo` requires a password (indicated by the "Missing sudo password" error message), use `apply-<playbook>.sh --ask-become-pass` and specify the password when requested ("BECOME password" message)
   - The playbook will set up passwordless `sudo`, so next time the `--ask-become-pass` parameter will not be required
6. When the administrative user is already created, use that user in the inventory instead of `root` (`ansible_user: <adminuser>`). This is more secure and also required by Homebrew.

## Bootstrapping hosts with authentication

1. Copy public SSH key, e.g.:
   `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub root@192.168.1.50`
2. Run playbook with existing user (`root` or your admin user if already created)
3. Verify the connection with: `ansible all -m ping`

## Useful options

The following parameters can be applied to `ansible-playbook` and the "apply..." scripts.

- `-l`, `--limit` - Limit Ansible run for a specific host (or host group). Example: `./apply-homelab.sh --limit <host>`
- `-v`, `--verbose` - Causes Ansible to print more debug messages. Adding multiple -v will increase the verbosity, the builtin plugins currently evaluate up to -vvvvvv. A reasonable level to start is -vvv, connection debugging might require -vvvv. Example: `./apply-homelab.sh -v`

See `man ansible-playbook` for more.
