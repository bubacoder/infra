# AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover all your home devices, and you won't need any client-side software for that
#
# To fix "listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use" error on Ubuntu: disable `DNSStubListener` (see Ansible)
