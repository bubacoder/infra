# AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover all your home devices, and you won't need any client-side software for that
#
# To fix "listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use" error on Ubuntu: disable `DNSStubListener` (see Ansible).  
# Follow the AdguardHome installation wizard for first-time configuration. (Note: Firefox may not allow access to the admin interface)
#
# Best practice:
#  1. Configure two instances of AdGuard Home on two separate hardware
#  2. Setup adguardhome-sync to sync the settings
#  3. Specify both DNS servers in the router's DHCP settings
