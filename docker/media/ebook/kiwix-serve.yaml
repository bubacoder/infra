# > [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/) is a non-profit organization and a free and open-source software project dedicated to providing offline access to free educational content.
# > We can make highly compressed copies of entire websites that each fit into a single (.zim) file. Zim files are small enough that they can be stored on users’ mobile phones, computers or small, inexpensive Hotspot.
# > Kiwix then acts like a regular browser, except that it reads these local copies. People with no or limited internet access can enjoy the same browsing experience as anyone else.
#
# Download content (`.zim` files) from https://library.kiwix.org/, place into `${STORAGE_KIWIX}` and restart the container.  
# More information on the `.zim` files: https://download.kiwix.org/zim/README  
#
# Container: https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-tools/pkgs/container/kiwix-serve  
# Applications for multiple platforms: https://kiwix.org/en/applications/  
# Android APK (supports sideloaded `.zim` files): https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/
