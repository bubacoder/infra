# WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache.
# It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.
# Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development,
# but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.
#
# Android - configure application exclusion, e.g. Android Auto: Open the Wireguard app, edit the profile, click "All Applications", select the application you want to exclude.
