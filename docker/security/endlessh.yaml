# Endlessh is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time.
# The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a real server.
#
# endlessh-go is a golang implementation of endlessh exporting Prometheus metrics, visualized by a Grafana dashboard.
