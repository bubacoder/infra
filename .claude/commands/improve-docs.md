# Improve Documentation

## Variables

FILES: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Improve the spelling, grammar, and style of markdown-based documentation files in this repository.

### Part 1 - Identify Documentation Files

1. If FILES is provided, use those specific files. Otherwise, find all markdown files in the repository using:
   - Search for files with `.md` extension
   - Focus on documentation directories like `docs/`, `README.md`, and other markdown files
   - Exclude generated files, third-party code, and non-documentation markdown

### Part 2 - Analyze and Improve Each File

For each documentation file:

1. **Read the file** to understand its content and purpose
2. **Check for issues**:
   - Spelling errors
   - Grammar mistakes
   - Inconsistent formatting
   - Awkward phrasing or unclear sentences
   - Missing or incorrect punctuation
   - Inconsistent heading styles
   - Broken links or references
3. **Apply fixes**:
   - Correct spelling errors
   - Improve grammar and sentence structure
   - Enhance clarity and readability
   - Ensure consistent markdown formatting
   - Fix any broken internal links
   - Maintain the original meaning and technical accuracy

### Part 3 - Quality Assurance

1. After improving each file, re-read it to ensure:
   - The content remains technically accurate
   - The tone and style are appropriate for documentation
   - Links and references still work
   - Code examples (if any) are still valid
2. Run any available linting tools on the modified files (e.g., markdownlint if configured)
3. Verify that the changes don't break any documentation build processes

### Part 4 - Summary

Provide a summary of all changes made, including:
- Files modified
- Types of improvements made (spelling, grammar, style)
- Any files that couldn't be improved and why

Notes:
- Preserve technical terminology and code snippets exactly as they are
- Maintain the existing documentation structure and organization
- Focus on clarity and professionalism while keeping the original voice
- If unsure about a technical term or concept, leave it unchanged
