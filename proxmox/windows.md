### Windows Package Manager / WinGet

> The Windows Package Manager is a tool designed to help you quickly and easily discover and install those packages that make your PC environment special. By using the Windows Package Manager, from one command, you can install your favorite packages:  
> `winget install <package>`

> Access to packages from two default sources. The first is "msstore" the Microsoft Store (free Apps rated "e" for everyone). The second is "winget" the [WinGet community repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs).

**Installation:**
Microsoft Store -> [App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1) package.
