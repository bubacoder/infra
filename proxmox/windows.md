### Windows Package Manager / WinGet

> The Windows Package Manager is a tool designed to help you quickly and easily discover and install those packages that make your PC environment special. By using the Windows Package Manager, from one command, you can install your favorite packages:  
> `winget install <package>`

> Access to packages from two default sources. The first is "msstore" the Microsoft Store (free Apps rated "e" for everyone). The second is "winget" the [WinGet community repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs).

**Installation:**
Microsoft Store -> [App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1) package.

> The main goal of this project is to create an intuitive GUI for the most common CLI package managers for Windows 10 and 11, such as WinGet, Scoop, Chocolatey, PIP, NPM, .NET Tool, PowerShell Gallery and more. With this app, you can easily download, install, update, and uninstall any software published on the supported package managers — and much more!
