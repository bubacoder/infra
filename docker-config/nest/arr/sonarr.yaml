# Sonarr (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab sort and rename them.
# It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
